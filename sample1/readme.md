 the architecture describes an AI agent that receives prompts from a user, understands the intent using NLP, and then interacts with different components like:

LLMs (for document understanding)
ML models (for predictions)
Code executors (for executing code)
Data sources (for fetching structured data)
Finally, it returns a task output.
